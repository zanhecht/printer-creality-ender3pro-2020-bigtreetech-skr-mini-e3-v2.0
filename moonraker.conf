[power printer]
type: tasmota
address: 192.168.1.201
password:
#   A password used to authenticate requests.  Default is no password.
output_id:1
#   The output_id (or relay id) to use if the Tasmota device supports
#   more than one output.  Default is 1.
off_when_shutdown: False
#   If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
#   the "shutdown" state.  This option applies to all device types.
#   The default is False.
#off_when_shutdown_delay: 15
#   If "off_when_shutdown" is set, this option specifies the amount of time
#   (in seconds) to wait before turning the device off. Default is 0 seconds.
on_when_job_queued: True
#   If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
#   device is off.  This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
#   print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
#   below for details. The default is False.
locked_while_printing: True
#   If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
#   printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
#   the printer's power.  The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: True
#   If set to True, Moonraker will schedule a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to command
#   after the device has been powered on. If it isn't possible to immediately
#   schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
#   will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
#   complete.  Prior to scheduling the restart command the power device will
#   always check Klippy's state.  If Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
#   FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
#   The default is False.
restart_delay: 5
#   If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
#   of time (in seconds) to delay the restart.  Default is 1 second.
bound_services: 
#   A newline separated list of services that are "bound" to the state of this
#   device.  When the device is powered on all bound services will be started.
#   When the device is powered off all bound services are stopped.
#
#   The items in this list are limited to those specified in the allow list,
#   see the [machine] configuration documentation for details.  Additionally,
#   the Moonraker service can not be bound to a power device.  Note that
#   service names are case sensitive.
#
#   The default is no services are bound to the device.
